what is going on rn ???
first commit
yeah
Create and checkout to a new branch from your current commit: git checkout -b [branchname]
Then, push the new branch up to the remote: git push -u origin [branchname]

git status: Always a good idea, this command shows you what branch you're on, what files are in the working or 
staging directory, and any other important information.
