what is going on rn ???
first commit
yeah
Create and checkout to a new branch from your current commit: git checkout -b [branchname]
Then, push the new branch up to the remote: git push -u origin [branchname]

git status: Always a good idea, this command shows you what branch you're on, what files are in the working or 
staging directory, and any other important information.

use "git checkout <branch name> " to switch to diff branches
then " git add <file name> " to choose a file in the branch 
" git commit -m <file name> " to save changes
final step would be using "git push --set-upstream origin <branch name> " to update changes
